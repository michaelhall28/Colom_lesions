A representative model of lesion loss in esophageal epithelium.   
Scripts that use Approximate Bayesian Computation to fit the model, and a model including only lesion-intrinsic stochastic drift, to observed data.  


Requirements: Python 3 and the python packages numpy (numpy.org) and pyabc (pyabc.readthedocs.io)  

By default runs on 3 cores. Edit NUM_CORES in the scripts to change.
